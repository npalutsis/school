Part 3: This program helps users use basic kinematics in order to calculate the new
position of an object. It prompts the user to provide the initial position, initial 
velocity, acceleration, and duration of motion in order to calculate the new position
using the equation x = x0 * t + .5 * a * t^2 and display it for the user. This was
executed by using the printf function in order to prompt the user for the values, and
then the scanf function was used to assign the values to the variables with the help
of %f because the values were float variables. An if statement was used after the t
variable was assigned. If the number was zero or positive the program continued on,
but if the input was negative a message was displayed to the user and return 0 was 
used to end the program prematurely. The value of the final position was also set to
round to three decimal points by adding %.3f instead of just %f. The program was
tested for correctness by inputing various numbers and checking the output compared 
to a calculator. It was also tested for negative values and it worked properly and 
ended the program when t < 0.
