   The program carnival.c opens a window for the user and displays an animated carnival ride. The ride operates from a base that shifts linearly from side to side. A support beam protrudes from this moving base. It rotates constantly between 45 and 135 degrees, and the length of the beam shrinks and grows as well. At the end of the beam is another hinge where a second beam hangs down. This beam also rotates and changes its length. At the end of this beam is a rotating pentagon from which 5 arms protrude from. At the end of these arms are spinning squares which represent the seats of the ride. The program quits when the user presses 'q'.
      The program works by using gfx_open() to open the window for the user, and then a while loop is used to continuously redraw and animate the shapes until the user breaks from the loop by the event of the button press of 'q'. Several variables keep track of the angles as well as the x and y positions of the shapes. Points were calculated from polar coordinates because it made it possible to easily increment the theta and radius values. Doing so created the effects of rotation and growth/shrinkage. The function polygon() was created which uses a for loop and polar coordinates to draw a regular polygon with a set number of sides and a set radius around a given center coordinate. In order to fill the shapes, this function and the gfx_circle were used within for loops. by incrementing the radius value from 1 to the max radius the shape was filled in.
