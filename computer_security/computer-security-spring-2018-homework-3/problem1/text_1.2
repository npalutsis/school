History has taught us: never underestimate the amount of money,
time, and effort someone will expend to thwart a security system.
It's always better to assume the worst. Assume your adversaries
are better than they are. Assume science and technology will soon
be able to do things they cannot yet. Give yourself a margin for
error. Give yourself more security than you need today. When the
 unexpected happens, you'll be glad you did.
